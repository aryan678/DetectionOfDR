# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a severe complication of diabetes that can lead to vision impairment or blindness if not detected and treated early. This project leverages Machine Learning to provide a highly accurate diagnostic system.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset of retinal images collected from diabetic patients. These images are analyzed to train and evaluate the performance of the diagnostic system.

## Features
- Early and accurate detection of Diabetic Retinopathy.
- Effective image preprocessing to highlight critical features.
- Utilization of advanced Machine Learning algorithms tailored for the task.

## Results
The approach achieves an accuracy of **94%**, demonstrating its reliability and effectiveness in identifying Diabetic Retinopathy.

## Conclusion
This project represents a significant step towards building AI-powered diagnostic tools for healthcare. By enabling timely detection of Diabetic Retinopathy, it contributes to improving patient outcomes and advancing medical technology.
